# CAPSLOCK

CAPSLOCK is a simple hugo theme for blog-like websites. It allows for good flexibility, and supports a few archetypes
out of the box such as gists.

To get started, you can either download the repo in its entirety or set it up as a git submodule.

    cd project/themes
    wget https://github.com/arlyon/CAPSLOCK/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    mv master CAPSLOCK
    cd ..
    echo "theme = \"CAPSLOCK\"" >> config.toml

or

    cd project
    git submodule add git@github.com:arlyon/CAPSLOCK.git themes/CAPSLOCK
    git submodule init
  
Then, you can explore some of the achetypes and get started.
